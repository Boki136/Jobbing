# JOBBING

## Project Overview

Jobbing is an employment website targeting both jobseekers and employers. Our mission is to connect people with new opportunities and give them a chance to chnage their careers & lifestyle forever. With access to more then 100 available jobs jobseekers can search & save jobs. On the other side, employers can post new opportunities in their company, edit or delete them.

# **UX**

The website is designed with simplicity & effectivness in mind, allowing users to easily grasp the website content. Primarily focus for a jobseeker is to easily navigate through the website to find a desired job. In the other hand, various CTA throughout navigation and homepage are allowing employers to post a job in minutes. From the support standpoint both user types have access to FAQ's & contacts us section for any queries they might have.

# **Research and Analysis Phase**

## **Brainstorming Ideas & User Stories**

One of the main reasons why I selected this business sector is to achive the CRUD functionality. By allowing users to manipulate the data in front of them. Also, to narrow down the funcionality I decided to enable jobseekers to search, save & deleted saved jobs, and employers to post & delete jobs.

**Long term goals:**

- Ultimately, the scope for this business is to allow job applications for jobseekers, and notifications of subbmited aplications for employers. This would include CV & cover letter upload, additional details subbmited by form and ability to contact the employer via message center
- Enable employers to view jobseeker profiles and message them.
- Allowing jobseekers to compare jobs & market them as checked, applied, not suitable.
- Include an online chat to improve the support throughout the user journey
