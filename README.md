# JOBBING

## Project Overview

Jobbing is an employment website targeting both jobseekers and employers. Our mission is to connect people with new opportunities and give them a chance to change their careers & lifestyle forever. With access to more then 100 available jobs jobseekers can search & save jobs. On the other side, employers can post new opportunities in their company, edit or delete them.

    - Business decision, long-term goals

# **UX**

The website is designed with simplicity & effectivness in mind, allowing users to easily grasp the website content. Primarily focus for a jobseeker is to easily navigate through the website to find a desired job. In the other hand, various CTA throughout navigation and homepage are allowing employers to post a job in minutes. From the support standpoint both user types have access to FAQ's & contacts us section for any queries they might have.

# **Research and Analysis Phase**

## **Brainstorming Ideas & User Stories**

One of the main reasons why I selected this business sector is to achive the CRUD functionality. By allowing users to manipulate the data in front of them. Also, to narrow down the funcionality I decided to enable jobseekers to search, save & delete saved jobs, and employers to post, edit & delete jobs posted by them.

**Long term goals:**

- Ultimately, the scope for this business is to allow job applications for jobseekers, and notifications of subbmited aplications to employers. This would include CV & cover letter upload, additional details subbmited by form and ability to contact the employer via message center
- Enable employers to view jobseeker profile and message them.
- Allowing jobseekers to compare jobs & mark them as checked, applied, not suitable.
- Include an online chat to improve the support throughout the user journey

### **User Stories**

As a **Jobseeker** , I want to:

i. Easily find posted jobs which are relevant to me. Save the jobs which I think are suitable for me.

ii. Have access to my profile setting and ability to edit/change them.

iii. Have a solid support channels throught the website journey.

iv. Have a deatailed information about each job presented to me - job title, description, location, salary etc.

As a **Employer** , I want to:

i. Have access to post all new opportunities that my arise in my company.

ii. Have access to edit, view & delete the job once posted.

iii. Have the ability to edit my company details should they change.

# **Design Phase**

## **Sitemap**

Sitemap creation allowed me to brainstorm webiste structure and decide which pages will be included - view [here](documentation/Site-map.pdf).

## **Colour pallet & Typography**

Colour pallet was determined by conducting competitor analysis and investigating the most commonly used colours for the selected business.
Playfair Display is the selected font for all the headings with sans-serif as a fallback. For the paragraphs and the rest of body text raleway is the used font with sans-serif as a fallback.

## **Wireframes**

All wireframes are created in Adobe XD. They are very detailed which was done on purpose to make the development process easier and shift the focus towards coding rather then thinking of design while coding.
Wireframes are saved in PDF file type and can be accessed [here](documentation/wireframes).

# **Features & Pages**

The website is consists of 8 unique pages:

- Homepage
